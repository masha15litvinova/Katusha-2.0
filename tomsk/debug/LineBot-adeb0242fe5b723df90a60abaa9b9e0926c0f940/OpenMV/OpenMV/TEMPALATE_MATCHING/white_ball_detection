# Template Matching Example - Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC)
#
# This example shows off how to use the NCC feature of your OpenMV Cam to match
# image patches to parts of an image... expect for extremely controlled enviorments
# NCC is not all to useful.
#
# WARNING: NCC supports needs to be reworked! As of right now this feature needs
# a lot of work to be made into somethin useful. This script will reamin to show
# that the functionality exists, but, in its current state is inadequate.
